# Pneumonia_model_creation_Without_data_augmentation

model created by using kaggle Pneumonia dataset

train_set samples : 5216

test_set samples : 624

All images have initially 3 channels (RGB)
trained on 20 epochs  , without data augmentation , images ( grayscale) ,resized to shape = (130 ,130 ,1) ,fit using batches  (32)
accuracy for predicting Normal --> 0.55
accuracy for predicting Pneumonia -->0.97
